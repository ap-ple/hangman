Hello, curious reader! Thanks for stopping by. I've uploaded this mini project to github in order to not only immortalize my works, but mainly to transfer files between computers. This will be constant with my other projects as well. A side effect of this is: you (yes, you!) the reader, will be able to help me learn more about python, and how I can do things easier. So if a more experienced programmer wouldn't mind taking 5 minutes to look over my code and point out what you think should be different, that would be amazing! Thanks so much for reading.
